# Flashtel

Flashtel is a quizlet clone as a challenge/practice project. Flashtel is 
designed to use gunDB to sync changes to flashcards across devices. While not a
full-proof method to persist the flashcards it allows for a free public version at
little to no cost for end users.

## Tech Stack
- Svelte/SvelteKit
